  <h1>HTML Tables</h1>
  <h2>Basic Table</h2>
  <p>The most simple table with 2 columns and 2 rows you'll ever create.</p>
  <table>
  <tr>
	  <td>Monday</td>
	  <td>HTML5 Template</td>
	  <td>Created template</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	  <td>Tuesday</td>
	  <td>HTML Elements</td>
	  <td>Created a HTML page with a proposal for our Webdesign project.</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
  
  <h2>Basic Table with Header</h2>
  <p>Below is the most common table format with one row for a table
     header and additional rows for table data. Note that using the
	 th element helps accessibility, and it also makes it easier to
	 style the table header differently to the table data.</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
	  <th>DAY</th>
	  <th>SUBJECT</th>
	  <th>EXERCISE</th>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	  <td>Monday</td>
	  <td>HTML5 Template</td>
	  <td>Created template</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	  <td>Tuesday</td>
	  <td>HTML Elements</td>
	  <td>Created a HTML page with a proposal for our Webdesign project.</td>
	</tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Table with &lt;thead>,&lt;tbody> and &lt;tfoot>,</h2>
  <p>Use the &lt;thead>,&lt;tbody> and &lt;tfoot> elements for large
     tables that may include a scroll bar or extend over several 
	 print pages.</p>
  <p>Note the nesting order of the &lt;thead>,&lt;tbody> and &lt;tfoot> 
     elements. In the past the &lt;tfoot> element was placed between
     the &lt;thead>,&lt;tbody> elements. See 
     <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_thead.asp">W3SCHOOLS</a>
     for an example of the 'old' way example as found on the 05/07/2017.
	 Now the correct nesting order is &lt;thead>,&lt;tbody> and &lt;tfoot>.
	 The new order will somehow make it easier to code tables dynamically.	 
  </p>
  <p>As we noticed today (05/07/2017), the old way as stated on
     W3Schools and the new way will both render correctly in the 
	 browser. However, only the new way will pass the W3C validation 
	 test.
